**The Solid Rubber Tyre Tyre Model** is a very nice and simple tyre model derived from assumptions, known concepts and trigonometry. 
It was created to be a simple, intuitive and non-empirical alternative to the **Brush Tyre Model** and **Fiala Tyre Model**. 
**!! Although _considered non-empirical_, it does feature just a _tiny amount of empirical values. Such as loadSensitivity or TyreStiffness (stiffness) or slope._**
Enjoy!
